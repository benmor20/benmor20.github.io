# Franklin W. Olin Players

During much of my time at Olin College, I was involved in the school's theater group, the Franklin W. Olin Players (FWOP). I started during my sophomore year as the Stage Manager for the fall musical, the Addams Family. In following semesters, I acted in Trap, returned to stage managing for Assassins, then directed Clue, assistant-directed Carrie, and, finally, acted in Seven Reversals for my senior spring.

## The Addams Family

This was my first production with FWOP, and my first production since I was in middle school, and I was asked to come on as the stage manager. In this role, I attended rehearsals, keeping track of every prop, set piece, sound effect, lighting cue, and actor entrance/exit (I got to try my hand at helping with directorial decisions as well!). Near the date of production, I brought on a team of three techies who, along with the ensemble, comprised the run crew. I was in charge of everything that went on backstage, ensuring that actors were cued, props were in the right place, and the scene transitions happened smoothly and efficiently. I can proudly say that we performed with very few hiccups.

## Trap

The following semester, I decided to join as an actor in our spring play, Trap, a documentary-style play about a tragedy that struck the local theater in Menachap, California. I played the part of Richenoch Baynor, a professor who studies fear, along with Times Magazine. While I was an actor in this performance, I also made some props, most notably custom-made LED light-up glasses for the finale of the show. This show was a ton of fun to be a part of, and one of the most talked about FWOP productions to this day.

## Assassins

For FWOP's fall musical during my junior year, I returned to my previous stage manager role. We had a smaller run crew for this production, so I had to put in the extra time to make sure that transitions were not only possible, but as fast as possible.

## Clue

The following semester, we made the bold decision of performing Clue (a play based on the 1985 movie) during Olin College's candidate weekends, Olin's equivalent of college interviews where prospective students come to campus to experience the culture and participate in interviews. This decision meant we had just over a month between auditions and opening night, with large amounts of technical work to be done and three different endings to rehearse. Due to the size of space available (a 12-foot by 26-foot stage in a glorified lecture hall) and the needs of the play (two rooms on stage at a time with a hallway in the middle) this was a very technically challenging play to put on in a month while also being full-time students. As director, I was in charge of ensuring our adaptation of the Clue mansion could work on our stage, creating the blocking to work with this stage, running rehearsals, ensuring tech (run crew, set builders, AV, etc) are all organized, running tech week, etc. While that month was tough and tech week was tougher, I am incredibly proud of the cast and crew that pulled this off to create an amazing performance!

## Carrie

During my senior fall, FWOP put on Carrie: the Musical (based off of the Stephen King novel). For this show, I stepped down to Assistant Director, where I was in charge of helping to run rehearsals, provide notes on blocking and help to actors, and mentoring the new director. The cast and crew were amazing, and we managed to put off one of the smoothest and most impressive shows FWOP has seen in a while.

## Seven Reversals

For my final semester at Olin, FWOP continued to put on Candidate Weekend performances. This time, we chose a much simpler play named slasreveR neveS (Seven Reversals) - a one-act play featuring seven different skits, each with a different "reversal". I fully stepped back from my directorial position, but was still present as a mentor for the new directors. Instead, I returned to act in my final show at Olin.

## Board Positions

During my time at FWOP, I also occupied multiple positions on the board. For my junior year, I was nominated to be the treasurer. As treasurer, I was responsible for allocating our budget across rights for the plays, set building, prob creation, lights, costumes, etc, and was in charge of working with administration and various rights agencies to purchase the rights for each play. That year, we ended up having enough left over to afford merch for the students that participated in FWOP the past two semesters!

The following year, I was elected to be President of FWOP. As President, I oversaw two plays - Carrie and Seven Reversals - and ensured the transition to the next generation of FWOP went smoothly (as much of FWOP's institutional knowledge was held by the senior class). I trained up new directors and encouraged other seniors do the same for their positions, and helped to create documentation for future years of FWOP so that not so much of the club's knowledge was held in the heads of individual students.
