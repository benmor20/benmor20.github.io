![Profile Picture](assets/PortfolioPic.png)

I am a Computing major at Olin College with a specialty in writing software to enable robots to make decisions.

## I get the complicated problems

In the summer of 2022, I developed a novel path planning algorithm for [the Hummingbird project](hummingbird.md), a new research project in Olin College's RoboLab.

## I understand the full cycle: from use to design to implementation

I [ran a project](easel.md) to identify and address workflow problems for professors' use of Canvas, a Learning Management Software.

## I thrive in environments in which people of different skills work towards a common goal

For my Collaborative Design class, I worked with a group of other engineers to design a product to improve the lives of service animal trainers; our solution was [SAFEcert](safecert.md).
