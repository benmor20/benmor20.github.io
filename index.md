I am a Computing major at Olin College with a specialty in writing software to enable robots to make decisions.

## I get the complicated problems

In the summer of 2022, I developed a novel path planning algorithm for [the Hummingbird project](hummingbird.md), a new research project in Olin College's RoboLab.

## I understand the full cycle: from use to design to implementation

I [ran a project](easel.md) to identify and address workflow problems for professors' use of Canvas, a Learning Management Software.
