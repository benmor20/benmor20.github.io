      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of engineering and computing, I was deeply involved in Olin College’s
        student theater organization, the <strong>Franklin W. Olin Players (FWOP)</strong>.
        Over multiple semesters I contributed as a stage manager, actor, director, assistant director,
        and ultimately as the club’s president. My work spanned technical stage management,
        artistic direction, and organizational leadership.

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Through FWOP, I developed collaborative leadership skills in creative contexts.
        I directed and supported technically challenging productions, coordinated teams of
        actors and crew, and ensured organizational sustainability by training and empowering
        new leaders. These experiences gave me a broader perspective on teamwork, communication,
        and storytelling beyond my technical work.
