# SAFEcert

I took a class called Collaborative Design in which we were tasked with understanding a people group and designing a product to improve their lives. My team's people group was service animal trainers.

During phase one of the project, we interviewed several service animal trainers in the Boston area to understand what it was like in their role. We learned the terminology, their day-to-day tasks, their aspirations, grievances, and successes. From these interviews, we created personas - three imaginary people with traits that represent our people group. We could then ask how these personas would react in different scenarios or how they would (or would not) benefit from different products.

In phase two of the project, we generated ideas for possible solutions to develop. We first had a brainstorming session where we generated over 200 separate ideas. Then we choose nine to move forward with, such as a treat-free enrichment toy, an app for puppy raisers to communicate with their organization, and a self-cleaning treat pouch. Finally, we settled on SAFEcert - a non-profit to train and certify businesses in interacting with service animals, their trainers, and their handlers.

Throughout our interviews and co-designs, we noticed two powerful themes from our people group. First was a value on public education. There is a lot of misinformation about service dogs, as well as a lot of service dog fraud, where people get vests for their pet dogs and bring them wherever they go. This combination leads to businesses being less accepting of service animals than they are legally required to be. Many handlers and trainers are asked to leave businesses, even though they have a legal right to be there.  The second powerful theme we found was a desire for discretion and privacy. Many handlers just want to be treated like everyone else, and many trainers only want to focus on their dog’s training. Unfortunately, both trainers and handlers often find themselves being approached by people who distract them. This could be as harmless as wanting to learn more about the dog or wanting to pet their dog, or it could be hostile, like accusing them of service animal fraud, or trying to “test” the dog. Dealing with this gets frustrating and annoying quickly. This is where SAFEcert comes in. SAFE stands for Service Animal Friendliness Education, and the organization's goal is to educate businesses on how to interact with service animals, their handlers, and their trainers, along with the laws surrounding service animals. The goal is that employees will be better equipped to handle any conflict, should it arise between patrons, while treating service animal trainers with the dignity and respect they deserve.

While actually creating this organization was far outside the scope of this class, it was incredibly well received. One of our interviewees, who attended our final presention, later reached out to us to say how much they loved our proposed organization, if we ever wanted to move forward with SAFEcert, they would love to help. Through this experience, I learned a ton about human-centered design, and how to make products right for the user.
