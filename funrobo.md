# Fundamentals of Robotics Final

For my Fundamentals of Robotics final project, we had to build a robot that can navigate Olin College's Oval while completing challenges along the way. We were provided with an Arrma Mojave RC base and some sensors that we could choose to hook up as we pleased, and had to make a robot to complete a slalom, cross a bridge, and go through a gate while navigating the Oval. You can find [the full challenge description here](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/blob/main/Resources/FinalProject2022_RevB.pdf). Please see our [final project repository](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/) as well.

## My Work

I was one of two main software teammates for this project. We decided to use a system of "brainwaves" to control the robot's movement. We built one wave for each factor to consider - i.e. "follow April Tags" or "avoid orange cones". Each brainwave would return a vector of values which would essentially map speeds and directions to how much that wave "wants" to move at that speed or in that direction. For instance, if the rover found a large orange blob to its right, the "avoid orange cones" brainwave would negatively weight the "turn right" section of the vector. The rover would then take each brainwave, add them up, and choose the speed and direction corresponding to the maximum value. This way, the rover can consider a large variety of factors, each competing for an optimal speed and direction, and choose the movement to best satisfy all of its needs.

We made [many brainwaves](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/tree/main/src/brainwaves) to control different aspects of the rover's drive that we could use in different sections of the course. For instance, we had a brainwave [to follow a given color](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/blob/main/src/brainwaves/follow_color.m) or just to [positively weight going straight](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/blob/main/src/brainwaves/go_straight.m). We then had [an arbiter](https://github.com/benmor20/CarGoNyoom/blob/main/src/arbiter.m) to collect each brainwave and determine what speed and direction should be used.
