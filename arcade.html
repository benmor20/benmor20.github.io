      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In my Software Systems class, I built two arcade-style games in C.
        The first was a flexible <strong>Pong implementation</strong> designed so new games could be added
        easily to the same application. The second was <strong>MineSnake</strong>,
        a creative mashup of <em>Snake</em> and <em>Minesweeper</em>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>My Contributions</h2>
      <h3>Pong</h3>
      <p>
        I worked on both the <em>Model</em> and <em>Controller</em>. To enable extensibility,
        I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/arcade-games/blob/main/src/states.h#L14-L30">State struct</a>
        and a <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/arcade-games/blob/main/src/states.h#L33-L48">State Manager</a>.
        These acted like an abstract class and stack-based manager for game states
        (e.g., start menu, Pong game, pause menu). This allowed seamless pausing and resuming
        without reloading states.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote the
        <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/arcade-games/blob/main/src/pong/pong.c#L76-L116">update method</a>
        for the Pong state and developed
        <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/arcade-games/blob/main/src/pong/pong_controller.c">controller logic</a>
        to track held keys (since our input library only registered press/release events).
      </p>

      <h3>MineSnake</h3>
      <p>
        MineSnake combined the fast-paced movement of Snake with the logic puzzles of Minesweeper.
        The snake revealed the board as it moved, uncovering bombs or food. Eating bombs ended the game;
        eating food grew the snake, with the goal of finding all hidden food on the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I again focused on the <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/minesnake/blob/main/src/model.h">Model</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/minesnake/blob/main/src/controller.h">Controller</a>.
        The model handled bomb placement, snake growth, and revealing regions of the board.
        Compared to Pong, this required more sophisticated logic to manage both real-time
        gameplay and puzzle-solving mechanics.

      <h2>Try It</h2>
      <p>
        To play MineSnake or explore Pong, clone the repos above and follow the setup
        instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/olincollege/minesnake/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.
        Both projects are fully open source.
