# Why is SAT NP-Complete?

For the final project in my Advanced Algorithms class, I decided to look into a problem that had been bugging me for most of the semester: we had learned that the best way to prove something to be NP-Complete was to prove you can use it to solve another NP-Complete problem, but then how was the first NP-Complete problem (boolean satisfiability, or SAT for short) proved to be NP-Complete? The basic definition most commonly presented is recursive. I decided to look into The Cook-Levin theorem, and how SAT was proved to be NP-Complete. Please see [my final write-up] for a full explanation, and [my presentation slides] for a shorter overview.
